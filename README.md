# Backend

This is the backend (api) for an app I am making for a school programming assesment and to present at an open evening for our school.    
The app is a chat app and will use websockets to let users communicate in real time.  
It will also use oauth2 authentication, hashing and end to end encryption to ensure the userdata is stored securely and that the app is secure.  
This api is written in python which is my main and favourite language whereas the frontend will be written in JS using Electron to make a desktop app.
